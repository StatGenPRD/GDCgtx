## DATA

#absolute path to directory with all *.dose.gz and *.info.gz files including HIBAG results
genotypes=/GWD/appbase/projects/statgen/GXapp/G-P_assoc_pipeline/GDCgtx/ABC123456/AnalysisReadyData/imputed-20120314

#absolute path to file containing eigenvectors from pre-imputation QC (should be provided by data scientist)
#Note, these are used by default as covariates for all analyses
#You may omit these by commenting out the line but beware that this is the only "view" into the genetic data prior to running the chunk analyses
#And therefore, the subject demographic summaries (which are calculated before the chunk analyses) will report PGxITT as ITT which is almost certainly false.
eigenvec=/GWD/appbase/projects/statgen/GXapp/G-P_assoc_pipeline/GDCgtx/ABC123456/AnalysisReadyData/genotypes/ABC123456-pca.eigenvec


## ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION


## Marker filters - one reason to adjust these is to remove variants likely to be poorly imputated to avoid inflation of lambda and cause over-correction of results for well imputed variants.
#Marker exclusion criteria for genome-wide analysis (these are bypassed for candidate variant analysis)
threshold.MAF=0.01
#Note Rsq is calculated based on doses of analyzable subjects (non-missing co-variates and endpoints, those in group) and won't necessarily match the Rsq reported in the minimac info file.
threshold.Rsq=0.01
